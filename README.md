# Socioeconomic and Other Inequalities in Unscheduled Care Admissions and Outcomes: A Study in Greater Glasgow and Clyde

## Overview
This project examines the impact of socioeconomic and demographic inequalities on unscheduled care admissions and their outcomes among the population in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region. The study is part of a larger research initiative within the oGRE challenge, focusing on public health issues in Scotland.

## Background
Unscheduled care encompasses medical services such as emergency departments, out-of-hours GP services, and walk-in clinics. Understanding the disparities in unscheduled care usage and outcomes is crucial for improving healthcare policies, particularly in addressing inequalities in access to and outcomes from emergency healthcare services.

### Key Objectives
- To analyze the relationship between socioeconomic status, age, sex, and ethnicity with unscheduled care outcomes.
- To explore the differences in outcomes such as 30-day mortality, same-day discharge, immediate hospital admission, and repeat presentations within 30 days.
- To identify potential disparities in access and outcomes to inform public health policies.

## Data Sources
The study uses data provided by the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Safe Haven. The data includes:
- **Demographics**: Age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation).
- **Unscheduled Care Data**: Emergency admissions, discharge information, hospital admissions, and comorbidities.
- **Time Frame**: Data collected between 2012-2022.

## Methodology
This study utilizes a retrospective observational cohort design. Data was analyzed using logistic regression to assess the associations between demographic factors and unscheduled care outcomes. The analysis was conducted within a secure Trusted Research Environment (TRE) to ensure data privacy.

### Key Outcomes Analyzed
1. **Mortality within 30 Days of A&E Visit**
2. **Same-Day Discharge from A&E**
3. **Immediate Hospital Admission**
4. **Repeat Presentation to A&E within 30 Days**

### Tools and Techniques
- Data preprocessing and analysis were performed using **R** within the NHS Safe Haven controlled environment.
- Logistic regression models were used to identify associations between demographic factors and healthcare outcomes.
- Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were calculated to evaluate model performance.

## Key Findings (To Be Published)
- The study identified significant associations between demographic variables and unscheduled care outcomes.
- Initial results indicate that older, sicker patients, especially those from deprived areas, experience worse outcomes.
- Socioeconomic inequalities were particularly evident in immediate hospital admissions and repeat visits, highlighting disparities in post-discharge support.

## Ethical Considerations
- All data analyses were conducted in compliance with the information governance protocols set by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.
- The study adheres to the principles of justice, equity, and confidentiality.

## Future Directions
- The findings of this study will inform public health policy recommendations for improving equitable access to unscheduled care services.
- Further research may focus on specific interventions to reduce healthcare disparities in deprived populations.

## Publication
The full study will be published in December 2024 as part of the University of Glasgow's oGRE challenge series.
